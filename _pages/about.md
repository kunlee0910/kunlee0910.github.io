I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and a member of [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/ebbinghaus/team/), [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), and [Finnish Centre for Pensions](https://www.etk.fi/en/). I will also be visiting the [Stone Center for Inequality Dynamics](https://www.inequalitydynamics.umich.edu/), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in Winter 2024.

As a quantitative social scientist and policy researcher, my research broadly focuses on how social inequalities are shaped - mitigated or reproduced - by welfare state institutions and social policies responding to changing labor markets and demographic transitions in advanced democracies. My projects have investigated socioeconomic consequences of pension reforms and inequalities in old-age labor markets, both as cross-national comparative research and single-case studies. I am also interested in researching labor market institutions, inequalities in social service use, and low fertility in East Asia.

My studies have been recognized by several awards, including [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/copy-of-2022) Dissertation Grant and [JESP/ESPAnet Doctoral Researcher Prize](https://espanet.org/doctoral-researcher-prize/).
