I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/) and a member of [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

As a quantitative social scientist and policy researcher, my research broadly focuses on how social inequalities are shaped - mitigated or reproduced - by welfare state institutions and social policies responding to changing labor markets and demographic transitions in advanced democracies. My projects have investigated socioeconomic consequences of pension reforms and inequalities in old-age labor markets, both as cross-national comparative research and single-case studies. My studies have been recognized by multiple awards, including [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/copy-of-2022) Dissertation Grant and [JESP/ESPAnet Doctoral Researcher Prize](https://espanet.org/doctoral-researcher-prize/).
