## Hi,

I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/ebbinghaus/team/), [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), and [Finnish Centre for Pensions](https://www.etk.fi/en/). In Winter 2024, I will be visiting the [Stone Center for Inequality Dynamics](https://www.inequalitydynamics.umich.edu/), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

As a quantitative social scientist and policy researcher, my research broadly focuses on how social inequalities are shaped - mitigated or reproduced - by welfare state institutions and social policies responding to changing labor markets and demographic transitions in advanced democracies. My projects have investigated socioeconomic consequences of pension reforms and inequalities in late working lives, both as cross-national comparative research and single-case studies. I am also interested in researching other policy issues related to labor market instability, low fertility, wealth inequality, and poverty.

My doctoral research has been recognized by several awards, including [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/copy-of-2022) Dissertation Grant and [JESP/ESPAnet Doctoral Researcher Prize](https://espanet.org/2022/09/30/jesp-espanet-doctoral-researcher-prize-3/).
