## Hi,

I am Tony Atkinson Fellow at [LIS Cross-national Data Center](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/about-lis/team/) and Research Associate at [Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://liser.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/kun-lee), under the [LIS2ER Joint Initiative](https://liser.elsevierpure.com/en/projects/liser-initiative/). I obtained my PhD in Social Policy in October 2024 from the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/kun-lee-0), where I remain as a research affiliate. In addition to the UK and Luxembourg, I previously worked as a visiting researcher in Germany ([University of Mannheim](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/ebbinghaus/team/), [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics)), Finland ([Finnish Centre for Pensions](https://www.etk.fi/en/research-statistics-and-projections/research/research-cooperation/)), the US ([University of Michigan](https://inequality.umich.edu/visiting-scholar-kun-lee/)), and South Korea ([Seoul National University](https://www.isdpr.org/en)) for various international collaborative projects.

As a quantitative social scientist and social policy researcher, my research broadly focuses on how social inequalities are shaped - reduced or reproduced - by welfare state institutions and social policies from a comparative perspective, against the common challenge of demographic transition and changing labor markets. My current and past projects have investigated related topics including the consequences of pension reforms, inequalities in late working lives, low fertility, family policy, poverty, and wealth inequality.
