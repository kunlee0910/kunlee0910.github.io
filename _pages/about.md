## Hi,

I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/kun-lee), University of Oxford, and an incoming postdoctoral research associate jointly at [Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Cross-national Data Center](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/about-lis/team/) & Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://inequality.umich.edu/visiting-scholar-kun-lee/), [University of Mannheim](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/ebbinghaus/team/), [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), and [Finnish Centre for Pensions](https://www.etk.fi/en/research-statistics-and-projections/research/research-cooperation/). 

As a quantitative social scientist and social policy researcher, my research broadly focuses on how social inequalities are shaped - reduced or reproduced - by welfare state institutions and social policies from a comparative perspective, against the common challenge of demographic transition and changing labor markets. My projects investigate related topics including the consequences of pension reforms, inequalities in late working lives, low fertility, family policy, poverty, and wealth inequality.

My doctoral research has been recognized by several awards, such as [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/copy-of-2022) Dissertation Grant and [JESP/ESPAnet Doctoral Researcher Prize](https://espanet.org/).
