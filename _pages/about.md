## Hi,

I am *(LIS)2ER* Research Associate jointly at [LIS Cross-national Data Center](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/about-lis/team/) and [Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://liser.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/kun-lee). I recently completed my PhD in Social Policy at the [University of Oxford](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/kun-lee) During my PhD, I was also a visiting scholar at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://inequality.umich.edu/visiting-scholar-kun-lee/), [University of Mannheim](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/ebbinghaus/team/), [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), and [Finnish Centre for Pensions](https://www.etk.fi/en/research-statistics-and-projections/research/research-cooperation/). 

As a quantitative social scientist and social policy researcher, my research broadly focuses on how social inequalities are shaped - reduced or reproduced - by welfare state institutions and social policies from a comparative perspective, against the common challenge of demographic transition and changing labor markets. My projects investigate related topics including the consequences of pension reforms, inequalities in late working lives, low fertility, family policy, poverty, and wealth inequality.

My research has been recognized by several awards, such as [Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy](https://www.horowitz-foundation.org/copy-of-2022) Dissertation Grant and [JESP/ESPAnet Doctoral Researcher Prize](https://espanet.org/).
