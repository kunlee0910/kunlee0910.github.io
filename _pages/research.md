The main themes of my projects include (1) public pensions and economic inequality, (2) inequalities in late working lives and retirement transitions, and (3) low fertility and work-family reconciliation policies.
My doctoral thesis can be openly accessed through [Oxford University Research Archive](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:9b64014a-4796-4150-b772-40f323fb2ce1).
For transparency and reproducibility of research, I intend to share replication files for all my studies as they are published. This page is being updated accordingly.
