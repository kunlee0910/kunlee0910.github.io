I am interested in teaching courses on social policy, welfare states, and social inequality, as well as on quantitative research methods. As a doctoral scholar, I have taught related courses at the University of Oxford and University of Mannheim. In the next stage, I aim to develop an interdisciplinary course encompassing social policy issues related to demographic aging and labor market changes from an international comparative perspective.
